# Fractalrs
Created this project so I can study Rust while making fractal!
I have always wanted to learn fractal generation.

## Fractals
[Fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) are a very complex subject, there many ways to generate one and many different fractals with different characteristics.

### Sierpiński carpet
The [Sierpiński carpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_carpet) is a very simple fractal. A fun thing about them is that when they are actually fractals (not just finite representations such as the one generated on this projetct) they have 0 area and infinite perimeter.
